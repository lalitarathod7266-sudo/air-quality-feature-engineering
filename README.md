# Project Title: Air Quality & Health Data Analysis

## 📌 Objective
To analyze air quality data and explore its relationship with health indicators using Python and feature engineering techniques.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, EDA

## 📊 Key Steps
1. Data Cleaning – handled missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
2. Feature Engineering – created new variables to better represent air quality.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis – identified patterns, trends, and correlations.
4. Visualization – developed charts to show pollution impact on health.

## ✅ Outcome
- Highlighted key pollutants affecting health.
- Prepared a cleaned dataset ready for predictive modeling.
- Gained insights that can support public health decision-making.
